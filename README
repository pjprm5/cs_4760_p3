The core functionality is working as intended.
The idea that the time was just supposed to be simulated took awhile for me to realize.
I was able to get the message queues working finally. 
The fork() was failing inside my main loop a lot and would stop at like 17-20 processes successfully forking... 
I was told to put nanosleep in there to smooth it out from a couple students and it worked out.
As I understand it, from my code and trying to follow specifications, the clock only updates once per iteration
of the main/parent loop. I ran it a bunch of times and got nearly the same times every time.
I then logged off delmar/hoare and logged back in and ran it, and the times were different.
The entire critical section for both oss.c and user.c is guarded by a blocking msgrcv.
oss.c only receives an mtype of 1 and sends out an mtype of 2.
user.c only receives an mtype of 2 and sends out an mtype of 1.
